                                Crimson Bay's Treasure is an action-RPG centered around the idea of venturing off the golden path to follow your curiosity. This design goal is supported by periodic incentives encouraging the player to investigate new places as they traverse the open world.

                                Each of the five regions contain a main objective that must be brought back to a base area. These are located within prominent setpieces, giving the player a sense of direction while they navigate the sprawling and interconnected layouts. Sightlines were carefully planned in order to guide players towards objectives while still preserving agency.

                                In order to encourage players to explore new territory, we created an item drop system which provides powerful and unique items, driving combat progression. Drops periodically appear as players advance, dynamically creating new points of interest for them to seek out. We placed these spots deliberately in order to draw the player out from the critical path, all the while finding new encounters and loot. The system picks nearby locations while avoiding using the same one multiple times in a row. It was crucial to the success of this dynamic that the flow of each area made these diversions feel like natural progression instead of forced interruptions.

                                Canonical Body is a a 2D mystery narrative adventure inspired by TypeRacer and TempleOS. As a university project, we were given a rigid set of guidelines and instructed to contain the project within specific genres and formats. However, my teammates and I had the clear goal to come up with unique mechanics and a fleshed-out narrative. We sought to take advantage of our unique strengths while keeping a manageable scope for a 6-month project.

                                The game takes place in the confines of an office cubicle, with the player mainly interacting with a computer terminal. Gameplay revolves around quickly copywriting pre-defined texts without making mistakes, akin to typing speed websites. As the player progresses, the game throws increasingly surreal obstacles at the player, such as pop-ups and corrupted segments that must be reconstructed.

                                In order to convey a certain sense of physicality, we introduced mechanics such as keys popping off as the player types, needing to be dragged back before they can be used again. We decided to use dragging as a consistent UX pattern for most game elements, including obstacles, puzzle pieces, and user interfaces the player can change the layout of. We also chose to subvert the player's expectations with certain interactions, such as the in-game keycaps' positions dictating input characters, instead of the player's actual keyboard. One of the three possible endings also involves accessing the game files in order to interact with the in-game photo gallery's system.

                                These simple mechanics ultimately serve the goal of telling a story themed around corporate culture, faith, and hopelessness about the future. We were able to craft a small but complete experience and explore new mechanics and modes of interaction, as well as narrative themes that deeply resonated with us. With this project, I learned a lot about scope control, narrative integration, as well as economical use of mechanics.

                                For my bachelor's thesis project, I worked on level design, controller implementation, and graphics for Pounce Palace, a first-person action game with high mobility. We sought to blend environmental storytelling with fast-paced action and movement challenges. We opted for Unity as an engine due to its flexibility, and I used ProBuilder as a prototyping and blockout tool.

                                I focused on building a flexible character controller that could be comfortably and quickly iterated upon. With it, I implemented and tested numerous movement tools, finally landing on a double jump, dash, and hookshot. The latter two double as combat abilities. By making use of interfaces, I kept the player code readable and easy to tweak, and ensured movement logic transitioned cleanly between states. Responsiveness was extremely important, with abilities having a satisfying feedback and impact. To this end, I implemented multiple elements such as hitstop and screen shake, as well as the ability to apply forces to the player.

                                In addition to testing the player's movement skills and supporting combat encounters, one of the main goals of the level is to sell the atmosphere and theme. I worked closely with the artists in our team to incorporate their environmental storytelling goals into the level and ensure my layouts and sightlines supported them. I also established our method for base asset placement and implemented several graphics features following our artistic guidelines, for which I used Shader Graph and HLSL. These include a highly configurable ambient fog, various damage and magic effects, as well as custom shaders for enemy, player, and decal rendering.

                                This level was part of a larger project, in which we aimed to create a competitive event with various PvP games. Our target ranged from seasoned Minecraft players to those who only had basic familiarity with the base game. For this reason, we had to design mechanics and spaces that worked regardless of the player's existing skill level with vanilla features. The goal of this game is to collect points that appear across the map while fighting other players for them using various collectible power-ups. It's designed to accomodate a large number of players, not only in its scale but also in its flow, guiding players to spread themselves instead of accumulating within the same point of interest.

                                My main focus with the level was to make it easy to learn for players with less experience moving through such environments. Floors are bright, changing color across height levels in order to boost readability. This is especially important given the map's high vertical density, which gives players the chance to use their many movement options. In order to help players distinguish where they are in the symmetrical layout of the arena, I gave each section a distinct theme and made sure most locations had sightlines to prominent landmarks. I also aimed to avoid clutter and reduce visual noise by placing decorative elements on walls or next to edges, giving enough room for players to move and fight in. The game also makes use of Minecraft's built-in sandbox elements, which meant I deliberately avoided using objects that obstructed block placing in the scene.

                                Our mechanic design revolved around ensuring everyone got to experience flashy and exciting moments while still encouraging skill expression. We also minimized the amount of built-in Minecraft mechanics we used, in order to create a more even playing field where all players had an equal chance to learn and compete. Our approach was to give each ability one very clear purpose while also adding secondary interactions which players could discover and take advantage of. For example, the Gravity Grenade's main use is to disrupt enemy players' movement by pulling them in and launching them. However, it also affects the thrower, meaning that with some practice, it can double as a powerful movement tool.

                                Bitstream is a first person action-RPG originally developed in one week. It features metroid-vania elements and non-linear progression options in a small open map. I worked on level and game design, including enemy encounters and loot. In it, you explore the fallen ruins of a long lost civilisation and bring it back to life as you progress. Your goal is to find 4 crystals and bring them back to the central monument, as well as 15 bonus hidden collectibles. The goal of this project was to create a 2-4h experience with interesting exploration and traversal options, an intriguing setting, and a cohesive aesthetic. We opted for simplicity on the side of enemy and looting mechanics, using mostly built-in features.

                                The map's progression is based around movement mechanics. As they explore, the player finds new items that allow them to reach new places and bring back water to dry areas. The first two items are given in a linear sequence, while the latter two are found by exploring the more open sections of the map.

                                Until the final area, the player is able to climb on most blocks, except copper. The last level is designed to invert this mechanic, with copper being climbable and allowing the player to cling onto it, while most other blocks in it are not. This changes how the player has to approach traversal and combat, needing to use the limited mobility afforded to them in clever ways, and testing the skills they've acquired.

                                In july of 2022, I led a community gamejam where participants got together to build a musical action-RPG in 24 hours. Over 30 creators participated, as well as multiple composers who created the soundtrack that the map was built around. This project required a strict source control pipeline, as well as clear guidelines for all participants.

                                Ahead of the event, I created a base graybox layout that established the full footprint of the level. While teams were free to modify it to fit their vision, setting an appropriate scale for each area was crucial in guiding participants to a manageable scope. Each team was tasked with creating all layers of gameplay integral to the map's genre, while integrating a theme based on their song of choice. Teams were manually assigned taking into account their stated preferences and soundtrack choice.

                                The resulting product is Songs of the Constellation. It was a greatly successful event, although substantial testing and shipping work was required beyond the core 24 hours. Despite the large number of participants, good asset management as well as effective communication allowed development to run without major incidents or blockers.
